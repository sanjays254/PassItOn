## Introduction

This app aims to encourage re-using products and reducing waste. In this consumer-driven world, we are buying, hoarding, and disposing more than ever. Almost everything non-perishable can be re-used by someone else. Letting go of that dust-collecting mug or that book you will never read again is now easier than ever.

**Available on iOS only.**
